# Model Improvement Results: Before vs After

## Summary: **Improvements Made Things WORSE** ‚ùå

### Changes Made:
1. ‚úÖ Increased `recent_weight` from 0.67 to 0.80 (weight last 4 games more)
2. ‚úÖ Added divisional game chaos factor (-1.5 points for both teams)
3. ‚úÖ Added blowout confidence reduction (cap predicted margins at ~14 points)
4. ‚úÖ Added interaction features (offense vs defense matchups)

### Results Comparison (Weeks 1-7):

| Metric | OLD Model | NEW Model | Change |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Winner Accuracy** | 63.9% | 62.0% | **-1.9%** üî¥ |
| **Spread Error** | 9.73 pts | 9.81 pts | **+0.08** üî¥ |
| **Total Error** | 13.67 pts | 13.59 pts | **-0.08** üü¢ |
| **Bet Accuracy** | 47.2% | 45.4% | **-1.8%** üî¥ |

## Analysis: Why Did It Get Worse?

### 1. **Over-Correction on Blowouts**
- Blowout reduction is capping predictions at 14 points
- But the model NEEDS to predict big margins sometimes
- Week 1 bet accuracy dropped from 43.8% to 18.8%!

### 2. **Divisional Chaos Penalty Too Harsh**
- Reducing both teams by 1.5 points in divisional games
- This is making close games even harder to predict
- Week 7 bet accuracy dropped from 40% to 33.3%

### 3. **Recent Weight Too High**
- 0.80 weight on last 4 games is too volatile
- Teams have hot/cold streaks that don't predict future
- Week 5 winner accuracy dropped from 35.7% to 28.6%!

### 4. **Interaction Features Not Helping**
- Added 3 interaction features (21 total vs 18)
- But Ridge regression can't use them effectively
- Need XGBoost to benefit from interactions

## Recommendations:

### ‚ùå REVERT These Changes:
1. **Blowout reduction** - Remove it completely
2. **Divisional chaos** - Remove or reduce to -0.5 points
3. **Recent weight** - Go back to 0.67 or try 0.70 (not 0.80)

### ‚úÖ KEEP These Changes:
1. **Interaction features** - Will help when we get XGBoost working
2. **Overall model structure** - Foundation is good

### üéØ What Actually Works:
Based on the data, the **OLD model (Week 7)** was performing best:
- 86.7% winner accuracy
- 7.93 point spread error
- Model was IMPROVING over time naturally

**The model doesn't need dramatic changes - it needs time and data!**

## Next Steps:

1. **Revert to old config.yaml** (recent_weight: 0.67)
2. **Remove blowout reduction** from model.py
3. **Remove divisional chaos** from features.py
4. **Keep interaction features** for future XGBoost
5. **Install OpenMP** for XGBoost: `brew install libomp`
6. **Focus on Week 8** - Let the model continue its natural improvement

## The Real Issue:

**The model was already improving naturally:**
- Week 1: 62.5% winner accuracy
- Week 7: 86.7% winner accuracy

**We tried to "fix" something that was fixing itself!**

The best strategy is to:
- Let the model learn from more weeks
- Get XGBoost working (needs OpenMP)
- Don't over-engineer corrections
