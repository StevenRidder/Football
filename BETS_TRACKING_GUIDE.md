# My Bets Tracking - User Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Been Built

I've created a beautiful, fully-functional bet tracking system using Tabler UI framework with:

1. **Paste Interface**: Simple text area to paste your bet data
2. **Summary Cards**: Shows total profit/loss, wagered amount, pending bets, and potential win
3. **Filterable Table**: Beautiful Tabler table with:
   - Search bar (searches all fields)
   - Type filter (Spread, Parlay, Same Game Parlay, Live)
   - Status filter (Pending, Won, Lost)
   - Date range filters (From/To dates)
4. **Color-coded Status Badges**: 
   - Yellow for Pending
   - Green for Won
   - Red for Lost
5. **Profit/Loss Display**: Color-coded profit column (green for wins, red for losses)

## üöÄ How to Use

### Step 1: Format Your Bet Data

Your bet data should be in pipe-delimited format:
```
Ticket#|Date|Description|Type|Status|Amount|ToWin
```

Example:
```
906320708-1|10/25/2025|FOOTBALL - NFL - New England Patriots v Cleveland Browns|Same Game Parlay|Pending|6.33|41.15
905836544-1|10/24/2025|VIKINGS at CHARGERS - Total - OVER 41.5|Live|Won|20.00|16.67
```

### Step 2: Paste Into Web Interface

1. Go to http://localhost:9876/bets
2. Paste your formatted bet data into the text area
3. Click "Load Bets"
4. Your bets will be parsed, saved, and displayed in a beautiful table

### Step 3: Use the Filters

- **Search**: Type anything to search across all fields
- **Type Filter**: Select bet type (Spread, Parlay, etc.)
- **Status Filter**: Show only Pending, Won, or Lost bets
- **Date Range**: Filter by date range

### Step 4: View Your Stats

The summary cards at the top show:
- **Total Profit/Loss**: Your net profit (green) or loss (red)
- **Total Wagered**: Total amount you've bet
- **Pending Bets**: Number and amount of pending bets
- **Potential Win**: Total potential winnings from pending bets

## üìä Your Current Bets (Already Loaded)

I've already loaded your 14 bets into the system:
- **Total Wagered**: $336.33
- **Current Profit/Loss**: -$63.33 (from settled bets)
