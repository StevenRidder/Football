## ⚠️ STILL NEED TO INTEGRATE (5 metrics)

1. **Early-Down Success Rate** - Should modify drive continuation probability on 1st/2nd down
2. **ANY/A** - Could adjust QB efficiency or pass success rates
3. **Drive Probabilities** - Fine-tuning (currently using hardcoded logic)
4. **Situational Factors** - Not yet loaded into TeamProfile (rest, weather, dome)

## Debug Logging

**TeamProfile** now has `debug=True` mode that shows:
- ✅ All loaded metrics with values
- ✅ Any fallbacks used (should be none)
- ✅ Any load errors

**Usage:**
```python
team = TeamProfile('KC', 2025, 8, data_dir, debug=True)
```

## No Fallbacks Policy

All data loading now raises `ValueError` if:
- File doesn't exist
- Team data not found
- Required metric missing

This ensures we know exactly what data is being used and catch missing data immediately.
