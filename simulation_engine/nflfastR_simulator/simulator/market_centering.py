Market Centering: Anchor simulator to closing lines.

Per strategy:
- Set simulator's mean to Vegas spread and total
- Model only the SHAPE: variance, tails, state-dependent skew
- Edge comes from distribution shape, not mean prediction

This is the KEY insight: We don't try to beat Vegas on the mean.
We model what they price poorly: variance and tails.
