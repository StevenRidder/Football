Comprehensive PFF Data Scraper
Extracts 5 years of PFF data (2020-2024 full seasons + 2025 weeks 1-8)

Data extracted:
1. Team-level grades (OL pass blocking, DL pass rush, coverage, run blocking, run defense)
2. Player-level grades (QB, OL, DL, WR, RB, TE)
3. Matchup-specific data
4. Advanced metrics (pressure rates, win rates, EPA)
