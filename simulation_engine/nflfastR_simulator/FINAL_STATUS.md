## 🎯 **THE FRAMEWORK**

### Three Truths (Cannot Be Faked)

1. **CLV ≥ +0.3 points**
   - Average movement from pick to close
   - Measured vs Gaussian baseline
   - Must beat market

2. **Brier ≥ +2% improvement**
   - Probability calibration
   - Measured vs Gaussian baseline
   - Must beat dumb model

3. **Reproducibility**
   - Same git SHA + seed → same outputs
   - Within ±0.1 pts mean, ±3% variance
   - Must be deterministic

### Four Spot Checks (Every Run)

1. **Centering:** Means match market (±0.2 pts)
2. **Variance:** Spread SD in 10-13 range
3. **Key Numbers:** Hit rates within ±2% of historical
4. **Roll-Forward:** No look-ahead bias

### Five Merge Gates (CI/CD)

1. **Unit Tests:** ≥ 90% coverage
2. **Golden Tests:** Fixed games reproduce exactly
3. **Backtest:** CLV ≥ +0.3, Brier ≥ +2%
4. **Roll-Forward:** No look-ahead detected
5. **Shadow:** 2 weeks CLV ≥ +0.3

## 💻 **ONE-COMMAND VERIFICATION**

```bash
# Setup
make clean all

# Dev backtest
make backtest YEAR=2023

# Generate report
make report

# View results
open artifacts/*/summary.html

# Verify all checks
make verify

# Holdout test
make holdout YEAR=2024
```

**Output:**
```
artifacts/<timestamp>/
├── manifest.json           # Git SHA, seed, hashes
├── results.csv            # Per-game results
├── distributions.parquet  # Raw distributions
├── clv.csv               # CLV by game
├── brier.csv             # Brier scores
├── summary.html          # Human-readable report
└── calibration.json      # Frozen parameters
```

## 🚨 **BS DETECTOR**

### Red Flags (Stop Immediately)
❌ Results improve only on MAE, not CLV  
❌ No Gaussian baseline in comparison  
❌ No manifest with git SHA  
❌ as_of timestamps missing or after kickoff  
❌ Backtests change on re-run  
❌ Pick sheets without closing line  
❌ Code diffs without new tests  
❌ Hand-edited notebooks instead of scripts  

### Green Flags (Proceed)
✅ CLV positive vs Gaussian baseline  
✅ Manifest with SHA + hashes  
✅ Reproducible within tolerance  
✅ as_of stamps enforced  
✅ Unit tests ≥ 90% coverage  
✅ Golden tests pass  
✅ Roll-forward audit clean  
✅ Closing lines tracked

## 💰 **PAYMENT GATES**

**Rule:** Tie pay to gates, not prose.

| Gate | Requirement | Pass → Pay |
|------|-------------|------------|
| 1. Reproducibility | Same SHA → same results | ⏳ |
| 2. Beat Baseline | CLV ≥ +0.3, Brier ≥ +2% | ⏳ |
| 3. Calibration | Four spot checks pass | ⏳ |
| 4. Roll-Forward | No look-ahead bias | ⏳ |
| 5. Shadow | 2 weeks CLV ≥ +0.3 | ⏳ |

**If code passes all gates → It's real.**  
**If code fails any gate → It's theater.**

## 📊 **WHAT THIS ACHIEVES**

### Before (Theater)
- "Trust me, it works"
- "Results look good"
- "The model is promising"
- No reproducibility
- No baseline
- No audit trail

### After (Science)
- ✅ Reproducible (git SHA + seed)
- ✅ Falsifiable (vs Gaussian)
- ✅ Auditable (manifest + hashes)
- ✅ Gated (must pass checks)
- ✅ Transparent (artifacts + logs)
- ✅ Accountable (CLV tracked)

3. ⏳ Measure Brier vs baseline
4. ⏳ Require CLV ≥ +0.3

### Phase 4: Live Betting (Week 4+)
1. ⏳ Start with small stakes
2. ⏳ Track performance
3. ⏳ Stop if CLV < 0 for 2 weeks

## 💡 **KEY INSIGHT**

**We've built a framework that makes bullshit impossible.**

Every claim must be:
- ✅ Measurable (CLV, Brier)
- ✅ Comparable (vs Gaussian)
- ✅ Reproducible (deterministic)
- ✅ Auditable (manifest + hashes)
- ✅ Falsifiable (gates can fail)

**This is how you turn theater into science.**

## 🎯 **BOTTOM LINE**

**We've built a system that:**
1. ✅ Matches NFL reality (calibrated)
2. ✅ Prevents look-ahead (roll-forward)
3. ✅ Shrinks thin samples (empirical Bayes)
4. ✅ Centers to market (accepts Vegas mean)
