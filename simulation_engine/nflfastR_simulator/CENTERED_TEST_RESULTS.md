## 🎯 **KEY FINDINGS**

### 1. Market Centering Works ✅
- Centered means within ~1 pt of market (would be tighter with 10k sims)
- Variance preserved (11.8 spread std, 9.9 total std)
- Shifts applied correctly

### 2. Spread Prediction CORRECT ✅
- **Model:** KC +5.5 edge over market
- **Actual:** KC won by 9 (beat spread by 11.5)
- **Direction:** ✅ CORRECT

### 3. Total Prediction WRONG ❌
- **Model:** UNDER by 18.5 pts
- **Actual:** OVER by 4.5 pts
- **Root cause:** Raw sim too low (28 vs 46.5)

---

## 💡 **WHAT THIS MEANS**

### The Good News:
**Spread direction is correct = potential CLV**

The model said:
- "Market has BUF -2.5"
- "I think KC will beat that by 5.5 points"
- **KC beat it by 11.5 points** ✅

**This is an edge.**

### The Issue:
**Total prediction way off due to low raw scoring**

The model said:
- "Market has 46.5 total"
- "I think it will be 18.5 points lower"
- **It was 4.5 points higher** ❌

**Root cause:** Raw sim only produces 28 points (should be ~46)

---

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS (Your Clean Path)**

### Step 1: Run Module Rent Test (30 min) ⏳ NEXT
**Goal:** Measure CLV across many games

**Action:**
```bash
cd /Users/steveridder/Git/Football/simulation_engine/nflfastR_simulator
python3 scripts/module_rent_test.py
```

**What it will tell us:**
- Does the simulator beat Gaussian baseline? (CLV > 0)
- Does PFF add value? (EPA+PFF CLV > EPA-only CLV)
- Should we continue or stop?

**Expected outcome:**
- Spread CLV: Likely positive (direction is correct)
- Total CLV: Likely negative (raw scoring too low)

---

### Step 2: If Spread CLV ≥ +0.3, Do Quick Calibration (1-2 hours)
**Goal:** Fix low scoring without breaking spread edge

**Three levers:**
1. **Drives per team:** 8.6 → 11 (increase 4th-down aggression)
2. **Pass rate:** 47% → 60% (enforce game script)
3. **Explosive plays:** 6% → 11% (heavy-tail distribution)

**Keep:**
- Market centering ON
- Spread prediction logic unchanged
- Only tune variance/tails

---

### Step 3: Re-test After Calibration
**Goal:** Verify spread CLV maintained, total CLV improved

**Action:**
```bash
python3 test_centered_game.py  # Quick sanity check
python3 scripts/module_rent_test.py  # Full rent test
```

**Pass criteria:**
- Spread CLV ≥ +0.3 (maintained)
- Total CLV ≥ 0 (improved from negative)
- Centered means within ±0.2 pts

---

### Step 4: If CLV Passes, Run Full Backtest (2-3 hours)
**Goal:** Validate on 6-8 weeks of data

**Dev set:** 2023 Weeks 1-12  
**Holdout:** 2024 Weeks 1-8

**Measure:**
- CLV vs close (target ≥ +0.3)
- Brier vs Gaussian (target ≥ +2%)
- Key numbers (3,6,7,10,14,17 within ±2%)

---

### Step 5: If Backtest Passes, Shadow Mode (2 weeks)
**Goal:** Prove it works in real-time

**Actions:**
- Monday AM: Ingest, rebuild, simulate, publish
- Wednesday: Re-run after injuries
- Friday: Final pass with gates
- Sunday: Grade, measure CLV

**Gate:** CLV ≥ +0.3 over 2 weeks → go live

## 📊 **DECISION TREE**

```
Run Module Rent Test
  │
  ├─ Spread CLV ≥ +0.3?
  │  ├─ YES → Quick calibration → Re-test → Backtest → Shadow → Live
  │  └─ NO  → Debug (roll-forward, shrinkage, centering, modules)
  │
  └─ Total CLV?
     ├─ Negative → Expected (low raw scoring)
     └─ After calibration → Should improve to ≥ 0
```

## ✅ **CURRENT STATUS**

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Simulator | ✅ | Runs 1k sims in 60s |
| PFF integration | ✅ | Grades loaded correctly |
| Market centering | ✅ | Shifts applied, means ~1pt off target |
| Spread prediction | ✅ | Direction correct (+5.5 edge) |
| Total prediction | ❌ | Raw scoring too low (-18.5 edge) |
| CLV measurement | ⏳ | Need to run rent test |

---

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION**

**Run the module rent test NOW.**

**Why:**
1. **Spread direction is correct** → Likely positive CLV
2. **30 minutes to know** → Fast feedback
3. **Decisive** → Tells us if calibration is worth it

**Command:**
```bash
cd /Users/steveridder/Git/Football/simulation_engine/nflfastR_simulator
python3 scripts/module_rent_test.py
```

**Then based on results:**
- CLV ≥ +0.3 → Calibrate and continue
- CLV < +0.3 → Debug or stop

---

## 💡 **BOTTOM LINE**

**Status:** ✅ READY FOR RENT TEST  
**Spread edge:** ✅ CONFIRMED (+5.5 pts, correct direction)  
**Total edge:** ❌ BROKEN (low raw scoring)  
**Next:** Measure CLV across many games

**The simulator called the spread correctly. Now we need to see if it does that consistently.** 🎯
