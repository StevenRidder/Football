# Step 2b: Shrinkage + Roll-Forward Integration - COMPLETE

**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FOUNDATION READY FOR INTEGRATION

---

## üìã **What We Have**

### Infrastructure Complete
1. ‚úÖ `data_loader.py` - Roll-forward with as_of stamps
2. ‚úÖ `empirical_bayes.py` - EB shrinkage functions
3. ‚úÖ `calibration.json` - Frozen calibration parameters
4. ‚úÖ `calibrate_scoring.py` - Validation harness

### Integration Points Identified
1. `TeamProfile._load_qb_stats()` - Apply EB shrinkage (Œª=150)
2. `TeamProfile._load_playcalling()` - Apply EB shrinkage (Œª=50)
3. `TeamProfile._load_epa()` - Apply roll-forward cutoff
4. All loaders - Add as_of timestamps

---

## üîß **Integration Pattern**

### For QB Stats:
```python
from data_loader import load_asof, latest_by
from empirical_bayes import shrink_qb_block

# 1. Load with roll-forward cutoff
qb_hist = load_asof(qb_splits_df, ["passer"], ("season","week"), season, week)

# 2. Get league prior
qb_league = qb_hist.groupby(["season","week"]).mean(numeric_only=True).reset_index()
league_row = latest_by(qb_league, ["season","week"], ["season","week"]).iloc[-1]

# 3. Get QB row
qb_row = latest_by(
    qb_hist[qb_hist["passer"] == self.qb_name],
    ["passer"], 
    ["season","week"]
).iloc[0]

# 4. Apply shrinkage
n_dropbacks = int(qb_row.get("dropbacks", 150))
self.qb_stats = shrink_qb_block(qb_row, league_row, n_dropbacks)

# 5. Add as_of metadata
self.as_of = {
    "season": season,
    "week": week - 1,
    "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
}
```

### For Play-Calling:
```python
# Similar pattern with Œª=50
playcalling_hist = load_asof(playcalling_df, ["team"], ("season","week"), season, week)
# ... shrink with Œª=50
```

---

## ‚úÖ **Verification Checklist**

After integration:
- [ ] Run `calibrate_scoring.py` - metrics unchanged
- [ ] Check as_of stamps present in all profiles
- [ ] Verify week-1 cutoff enforced (no look-ahead)
- [ ] Confirm shrinkage weights logged
- [ ] Test reproducibility (same seed ‚Üí same results)

---

## üìä **Expected Output**

### Team Profile with Metadata:
```python
{
    "team": "KC",
    "season": 2024,
    "week": 9,
    "as_of": {
        "season": 2024,
        "week": 8,
        "timestamp": "2025-10-30T12:00:00Z"
    },
    "qb_stats": {
        "completion_pct_clean": 0.68,  # Shrunk from 0.72
        "shrinkage_weight": 0.75,  # 150/(150+50) for 50 dropbacks
        "n_dropbacks": 50
    },
    "playcalling": {
        "pass_rate": 0.62,  # Shrunk from 0.65
        "shrinkage_weight": 0.80,  # For 80 plays
        "n_plays": 80
    }
}
```

## üéØ **Why This Matters**

1. **No look-ahead bias** - Only uses data through week-1
2. **Thin samples handled** - Small-n QBs don't whipsaw model
3. **Reproducibility** - as_of stamps enable audit trail
4. **Transparency** - Shrinkage weights logged
5. **Market-ready** - Foundation for CLV testing

---

## üöÄ **Next Steps (Steps 3-6)**

Once integration is verified:

### Step 3: Market Centering (30 min)
- Re-enable `center_to_market()` in `GameSimulator`
- Validate mean within ¬±0.2 pts
- Persist raw + centered distributions

### Step 4: Variance + Tails (1 hour)
- Generate reliability plots
- Check key numbers (3,6,7,10,14,17)
- Tune only variance knobs

### Step 5: CLV Rent Tests (2 hours)
- Gaussian baseline
- Test modules one by one
- Keep only if CLV ‚â• +0.3

### Step 6: Weekly Loop + Shadow (4 hours)
- Schedule jobs (Mon: ingest, Tue/Wed/Fri: simulate)
- 5 buttons: Update, Rebuild, Simulate, Publish, Grade
- 2 weeks shadow, then CLV gate

## üí° **Implementation Note**

The integration code is straightforward but requires careful testing. The pattern is:
1. Load with roll-forward
2. Get league prior
3. Get entity row
4. Apply shrinkage
5. Add as_of metadata

This pattern applies to:
- QB stats (Œª=150)
- Play-calling (Œª=50)
- Any future thin-sample features

---

## üìù **Status**

**Current:** Infrastructure complete, integration pattern defined  
**Next:** Apply pattern to `TeamProfile` and verify  
**Time:** 45 min integration + 15 min verification = 1 hour  
**Then:** March through Steps 3-6

This is the bridge from calibrated prototype to market-ready system.
