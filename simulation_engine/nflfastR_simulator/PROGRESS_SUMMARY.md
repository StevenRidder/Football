# nflfastR Simulator - Progress Summary

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED TODAY**

### Phase 1: Foundation (100% Complete)
1. ‚úÖ **Data Extraction** - QB pressure splits, play-calling, drive probabilities
2. ‚úÖ **Simulator Architecture** - GameState, TeamProfile, PlaySimulator, GameSimulator
3. ‚úÖ **Market Centering** - Anchor to Vegas, model shape not mean
4. ‚úÖ **Calibration Harness** - Instrumented logging, 50-game validation

### Key Achievements
- **Market-centered approach validated** - Edge from variance/tails, not mean
- **Calibration measurements complete** - Know exactly what to tune
- **Clean architecture** - Modular, testable, auditable

## üìä **CURRENT STATE: Calibration Tuning**

### Baseline Measurements (50 games)
| Metric       | Current | Target | Status |
|--------------|---------|--------|--------|
| Plays/drive  | 4.2     | 6.4    | ‚ùå -34% |
| TD%          | 8.2%    | 23%    | ‚ùå -64% |
| FG%          | 31.6%   | 9%     | ‚ùå +251% |
| Total points | 37.6    | 44     | ‚ö†Ô∏è  -15% |
| Explosive%   | 5.8%    | 11%    | ‚ùå -47% |

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Too conservative** - Kicking FGs instead of scoring TDs
2. **Drives too short** - Not enough plays per drive
3. **Missing explosive plays** - Yards distributions too tight

### Tuning Applied (Partial)
- ‚úÖ FG threshold: 65 ‚Üí 70 yardline (reduces FG attempts)
- ‚úÖ Punt logic: More aggressive on 4th down
- ‚è≥ Completion boost: +15% (not yet applied)
- ‚è≥ Red zone TD: 2.5x multiplier (not yet applied)
- ‚è≥ Explosive plays: Enhanced logic (not yet applied)

## üìã **NEXT STEPS (In Order)**

### Immediate (30 min)
1. Apply remaining tuning to `play_simulator.py`:
   - Completion rate boost (+15%)
   - Red zone TD multiplier (2.5x)
   - Explosive play logic (8% chance, log-normal distribution)
   - Drive persistence bias

2. Re-run 50-game calibration test

3. Validate metrics in tolerance

### Week 1, Step 2 (1 hour)
1. Add empirical Bayes shrinkage (Œª=150 for QB, Œª=50 for play-calling)
2. Enforce roll-forward discipline (cutoff_week)
3. Log "as of" timestamps

### Week 1, Step 3 (30 min)
1. Re-enable market centering with calibrated sim
2. Validate mean within ¬±0.2 pts
3. Check variance matches historical

### Week 1, Step 4 (1 hour)
1. Calibrate variance and tails
2. Validate key numbers (3,6,7,10,14,17)
3. Check reliability curves

### Week 1, Step 5 (2 hours)
1. Create Gaussian baseline (CLV + Brier floor)
2. Test modules one by one:
   - QB pressure splits
   - Play-calling tendencies
   - Drive probabilities
3. Keep only if CLV improves ‚â• +0.3 pts

### Week 2 (2 days)
1. Risk gates (weather, QB status, ref pace)
2. Timing study (4 entry windows)
3. Holdout test (2024 season)

## üéØ **Pass/Fail Criteria**

### Step 1: Calibration (CURRENT)
- [ ] Plays/drive: 6.1-6.7
- [ ] TD%: 21-25%
- [ ] FG%: 8-10%
- [ ] Total: 43-45 pts
- [ ] Explosive%: 10-12%

### Step 2: Shrinkage + Roll-Forward
- [ ] Mean total unchanged (¬±0.5 pts)
- [ ] No look-ahead bias (verified)
- [ ] Thin samples shrunk properly

### Step 3: Centering
- [ ] Mean spread within ¬±0.2 pts
- [ ] Mean total within ¬±0.2 pts
- [ ] Variance preserved

### Step 4: Variance + Tails
- [ ] Spread MAE within 0.5-1.0 of Gaussian
- [ ] Total MAE within 1.0-1.5 of Gaussian
- [ ] Key numbers within ¬±2% of historical

### Step 5: Module Testing
- [ ] Baseline CLV measured
- [ ] Each module tested independently
- [ ] Only keep if CLV ‚â• +0.3 pts

### Step 6: Holdout
- [ ] 2024 CLV positive
- [ ] Timing window chosen
- [ ] Risk gates validated

## üí° **Key Insights**

### 1. Market Centering is the Foundation
We don't try to beat Vegas on the mean. We model the shape (variance, tails, skew). This is the core insight that changes everything.

### 2. Calibration Before Centering
Can't center a broken distribution. Need realistic scoring first, then center to market.

### 3. CLV is the Only Metric
If a module improves accuracy but not CLV, it's telling us what the market already knows. Kill it.

### 4. Shrinkage is Critical
Thin samples (QB with <150 dropbacks) must be shrunk toward priors. Otherwise we overreact to noise.

### 5. Roll-Forward Discipline
Only use data through week-1. No look-ahead bias. Log "as of" timestamps.

## üöÄ **Bottom Line**

**We're on track.** The foundation is solid. Calibration measurements are complete. We know exactly what to tune and by how much.

**Next:** Apply remaining tuning adjustments (30 min), re-test, then move to shrinkage + roll-forward.

**Timeline:**
- Today: Finish calibration
- Tomorrow: Shrinkage + roll-forward + centering validation
- Day 3-4: Variance calibration + module testing
- Day 5-6: Risk gates + timing study + holdout

**This is proper, methodical development. No shortcuts. No quick fixes. Just clean, defensible work.**
