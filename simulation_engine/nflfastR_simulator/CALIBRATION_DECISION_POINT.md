# Calibration Decision Point

## üéØ **Current Status**

After 5 iterations of tuning, we have:

| Metric          | Current | Target    | Status |
|-----------------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Plays/drive     | 5.6     | 6.0-6.8   | ‚ùå Close |
| Drives/team     | 10.1    | 10-12     | ‚úÖ PASS |
| TD%             | 15.8%   | 22-24%    | ‚ùå Low |
| FG%             | 15.1%   | 8-10%     | ‚ùå High |
| **Turnover%**   | **17.7%** | **10-12%** | **‚ùå ROOT CAUSE** |
| Total points    | 31.6    | 42-46     | ‚ùå Low |

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

**The turnover rate is 50% too high** (17.7% vs 10-12%). This is causing:
1. **Low total points** (31.6 vs 42-46) - Drives end in turnovers instead of scores
2. **Low TD%** (15.8% vs 22-24%) - Not reaching end zone
3. **High FG%** (15.1% vs 8-10%) - Kicking more FGs because not scoring TDs

**Why is turnover% high?**
- Base INT rates in QB stats are too high
- Fumble rates might be too high
- Need to reduce turnover probability across the board

## üìä **Calibration Progress**

### Iteration Summary
| Iter | Plays/drive | TD%   | FG%   | Turnover% | Total |
|------|-------------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
| 0    | 4.2         | 8.2%  | 31.6% | 9.0%      | 37.6  |
| 1    | 4.1         | 9.6%  | 33.7% | 10.7%     | 45.8  |
| 2    | 4.5         | 13.7% | 30.1% | 12.1%     | 47.0  |
| 3    | 6.6         | 25.2% | 5.9%  | 18.7%     | 30.3  |
| 4    | 6.0         | 21.8% | 9.2%  | 18.4%     | 31.6  |
| 5    | 5.6         | 15.8% | 15.1% | 17.7%     | 31.6  |

**Pattern:** We can hit individual metrics, but turnover% keeps spiking when we boost other metrics.

## ü§î **Decision Options**

### Option 1: Continue Calibration (Recommended)
**Action:** Directly reduce turnover rates in the simulator
- Reduce INT rate by 40% (not 15%, but 40%)
- Reduce fumble rate by 50%
- Re-test

**Pros:**
- Will fix the root cause
- Should bring all metrics into range
- Clean, methodical

**Cons:**
- 1 more iteration (~10 min)

**Expected Result:**
- Turnover%: 17.7% ‚Üí 10-12% ‚úÖ
- Total: 31.6 ‚Üí 42-46 ‚úÖ
- TD%: 15.8% ‚Üí 22-24% ‚úÖ

### Option 2: Accept "Good Enough" Calibration
**Action:** Freeze current calibration with known biases
- Document that turnover% is high
- Proceed to shrinkage + roll-forward
- Re-calibrate later if needed

**Pros:**
- Move forward now
- Can always re-calibrate

**Cons:**
- Simulator won't match NFL reality
- Centering to market will be harder
- CLV tests will be noisy

### Option 3: Simplify the Simulator
**Action:** Remove some complexity
- Use simpler turnover logic
- Use simpler scoring logic
- Focus on getting the basics right

**Pros:**
- Easier to calibrate
- More stable

**Cons:**
- Less realistic
- May lose signal

## üí° **My Recommendation**

**Option 1: One more iteration with aggressive turnover reduction.**

The pattern is clear:
- We CAN control the metrics
- Turnover% is the blocker
- One targeted fix should work

**Specific changes:**
```python
# In simulate_pass_play():
qb_stats['int_rate'] = qb_stats['int_rate'] * 0.60  # -40% INTs

# In completion/sack outcomes:
fumble = np.random.random() < 0.005  # Half the fumble rate
```

**Expected time:** 10 minutes (apply + test)

Then we can freeze calibration and move to shrinkage + roll-forward.

## üöÄ **What I Need From You**

**Choose:**
1. ‚úÖ **Continue calibration** - I'll apply the turnover fix now
2. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Accept current state** - Move to shrinkage with known biases
3. üîÑ **Simplify simulator** - Rebuild with simpler logic

**Your call.**
