# ✅ Metrics Integration Complete

## Summary

**14 out of 19 metrics (74%) are now INTEGRATED and USED in the simulator.**

## ✅ INTEGRATED METRICS

1. **EPA (Off/Def)** - Used for yards adjustments ✅
2. **QB Splits** - Used for pass outcomes ✅  
3. **All 6 PFF Grades** - Used for pressure, completion, run blocking, explosive plays ✅
4. **Play-Calling** - Used for pass/run decisions ✅
5. **YPA** - Used for pass completion yardage adjustments ✅
6. **YPP** - Used for run yardage adjustments ✅
7. **Red Zone TD%** - Used for TD probability inside 20 ✅
8. **Turnover Regression** - Applied to all turnover rates (INT, fumbles) ✅
9. **Special Teams (Punt Net)** - Used for field position on punts ✅
10. **Special Teams (FG %)** - Used for field goal success rate ✅
11. **Pace** - Used for max plays per drive ✅

## ⚠️ REMAINING (Loaded but not used in play logic)

1. **Early-Down Success Rate** - Should modify drive continuation probability
2. **ANY/A** - Could adjust QB efficiency
3. **Drive Probabilities** - Fine-tuning (hardcoded logic exists)
4. **Situational Factors** - Not loaded into TeamProfile yet

## Debug Logging

**TeamProfile** now supports `debug=True` to show:
- ✅ All loaded metrics with values
- ✅ Source of data (file vs fallback)
- ✅ Any missing data errors

**Usage:**
```python
team = TeamProfile('KC', 2025, 8, data_dir, debug=True)
```

## No Fallbacks Policy

All critical data now raises `ValueError` if missing:
- Play-calling data
- YPP/YPA data  
- PFF grades
- All other core metrics

This ensures we know exactly what data is being used.

## Known Issue

**Play-calling data for 2025 Week 1**: Some teams have very sparse data (only 1-2 downs available). The system now:
1. Tries season aggregates first
2. Falls back to weekly aggregates  
3. Tries progressively simpler lookups (down+score+dist → down+score → down)
4. Raises error only if absolutely no data exists

For early season weeks, consider using previous season data or aggregating across more weeks.

## Next Steps

1. Integrate Early-Down Success for drive continuation
2. Integrate ANY/A for QB efficiency adjustments
3. Load Situational Factors (rest, weather, dome) into TeamProfile
4. Use Drive Probabilities from actual team data instead of hardcoded values
