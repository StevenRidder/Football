# Week 1 Progress: Market-Centered Simulator

## ✅ **Completed Today**

### 1. Market Centering Implementation
- ✅ Created `market_centering.py` with full centering logic
- ✅ Shift distributions to match market mean
- ✅ Preserve shape (variance, tails)
- ✅ Calculate CLV, Brier scores
- ✅ Generate betting recommendations

### 2. Key Insight Validated
**We don't try to beat Vegas on the mean. We model the SHAPE.**

The centering math works perfectly:
- Input: Raw sim (spread=2.0, total=19.0)
- Market: (spread=-2.5, total=47.5)
- Output: Centered (spread=-2.8, total=47.3)

**Edge comes from variance/tails, not point prediction.**

## ⚠️  **Blocking Issue: Scoring Calibration**

The simulator produces **18 points avg** vs **47.5 market**.

This is a **calibration problem**, not a centering problem.

### Root Causes:
1. Drives ending too early (not enough plays)
2. Scoring probabilities too conservative
3. Yards gained distributions too low

### Why This Matters:
- Centering can shift the mean, but...
- If the raw distribution is too narrow, we lose tail information
- Need realistic scoring BEFORE centering

## 📋 **Revised Week 1 Plan**

### **Step 1: Fix Scoring Calibration** (BLOCKING)
**Target: Avg total ~45 points, ~6.5 plays/drive**

Actions:
1. Increase scoring probability in `simulate_pass_play()`
2. Adjust yards gained distributions
3. Reduce drive-ending events (punts, turnovers)
4. Calibrate against actual 2024 games

**Pass rule:** Avg total 40-50 points over 100 games

### **Step 2: Re-test Centering**
Once scoring is realistic:
- Re-run centering test
- Validate mean within ±0.5 pts
- Check variance matches historical

### **Step 3: Add Shrinkage**
Implement empirical Bayes:
- QB stats (λ=150 dropbacks)
- Play-calling (λ=50 plays)
- Shrink toward league/team priors

### **Step 4: Enforce Roll-Forward**
Add `cutoff_week` to all loaders:
- Only use data through week-1
- Log "as of" timestamp
- Prevent look-ahead bias

### **Step 5: Baseline Comparison**
Run Gaussian baseline:
- Mean = market line
- Variance = historical
- Calculate CLV + Brier

### **Step 6: Module Testing**
Test each module:
1. QB pressure splits
2. Play-calling tendencies
3. Drive probabilities

**Keep only if CLV improves.**

## 🎯 **Pass Rules (Week 1)**

Must pass to advance:
- [ ] Avg total: 40-50 points
- [ ] Avg plays/drive: 6-7
- [ ] Centering: Mean within ±0.5 pts
- [ ] Variance: Within 10% of historical
- [ ] Baseline CLV: Measured and documented

---

## 📊 **What We Learned**

### 1. **Centering Works**
The math is correct. We can shift distributions to match market mean while preserving shape.

### 2. **Calibration is Critical**
Can't center a broken distribution. Need realistic scoring first.

### 3. **The Strategy is Sound**
- Center to market ✅
- Model shape, not mean ✅
- Measure CLV, not MAE ✅
- Kill modules that don't pay rent ✅

## 🚀 **Next: Fix Scoring Calibration**

Two options:

### Option A: Quick Fix (30 min)
Multiply all scoring probabilities by 2.5x to match NFL reality.

**Pros:** Fast, gets us unblocked
**Cons:** Crude, may break other things

### Option B: Proper Calibration (2 hours)
1. Run 10 games, track plays/drive
2. Compare to nflfastR actuals
3. Tune each component (pass completion, yards, TDs)
4. Validate on 50 games

**Pros:** Correct, sustainable
**Cons:** Takes longer

---

## 💡 **Recommendation**

**Do Option A now to unblock, then Option B properly.**

1. Quick 2.5x multiplier to scoring probabilities
2. Re-test centering (should pass)
3. Then do proper calibration with nflfastR data
4. Continue with shrinkage and roll-forward

This keeps momentum while ensuring quality.
