# Phase 1 Validation Results

## 🎯 Goal
Test if PFF OL/DL matchup data provides predictive edge over our current EPA-only model.

## 📊 Data Collected
- **Source**: Real PFF team grades from premium.pff.com (via Playwright scraping)
- **Years**: 2022-2024 (3 full seasons)
- **Games**: 624 completed games
- **Metrics**: Pass Block Grade, Pass Rush Grade, calculated pressure edges

## 🔬 Tests Performed

### Test 1: Correlation with Point Differential
- **Pressure Advantage Correlation**: 0.3852 (p < 0.000001) ✅
- **Market Spread Correlation**: 0.4404 (p < 0.000001) ✅
- **Winner**: Market spread is more predictive

### Test 2: Big Mismatch Games
- **Threshold**: Top 25% of pressure mismatches (>20.43 grade differential)
- **Big Mismatch Avg Point Diff**: 12.81 points
- **Small Mismatch Avg Point Diff**: 10.10 points
- **T-test**: t=3.27, p=0.001 ✅ SIGNIFICANT
- **Conclusion**: Games with big OL/DL mismatches are more lopsided

### Test 3: Directional Prediction
- **Pressure Advantage Accuracy**: 62.7% (beats 50% baseline) ✅
- **Market Spread Accuracy**: 69.1% ✅
- **Winner**: Market spread is more accurate

## 💡 Key Findings

### ✅ What Works
1. **PFF matchup data HAS predictive signal** - all tests significant
2. **Big mismatches matter** - games with large OL/DL gaps are more lopsided
3. **Better than random** - 62.7% directional accuracy beats coin flip

### ❌ What Doesn't Work
1. **Not better than market spread** - Vegas already prices this in
2. **Weaker than market** - 0.3852 vs 0.4404 correlation
3. **Lower accuracy** - 62.7% vs 69.1% directional prediction

## 🤔 The Critical Question

**Does PFF data add INCREMENTAL value when combined with EPA?**

Our current EPA-only Monte Carlo model:
- 2024 Backtest: 80%+ win rate, 50%+ ROI
- Uses rolling EPA (offense/defense efficiency)
- No matchup-specific adjustments

PFF matchup data could add value if:
1. It captures something EPA doesn't (OL/DL quality)
2. It helps identify games where EPA might be misleading
3. Combined features (EPA + OL/DL mismatch) beat EPA alone

## 📋 Next Steps

### Option A: Add to Current Model (Quick Test)
- Add `net_pressure_advantage` as feature to Ridge model
- Backtest on 2022-2024 data
- Compare: EPA-only vs EPA+PFF
- **Time**: 1-2 hours
- **Risk**: Low (just testing)

### Option B: Build Full Simulation (Long-term)
- Integrate PFF into possession-by-possession sim
- Model how OL/DL affects drive outcomes
- Add QB pressure vulnerability
- **Time**: 1-2 weeks
- **Risk**: High (complex, might not work)

### Option C: Skip PFF, Focus on EPA
- Current EPA model is already profitable
- PFF data doesn't beat market alone
- Focus on improving EPA features instead
- **Time**: 0 hours
- **Risk**: None (status quo)

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Option A: Quick Test**

Rationale:
1. PFF has signal (0.3852 correlation is real)
2. Might add incremental value to EPA
3. Low cost to test (1-2 hours)
4. If it doesn't help, we know for sure

If Option A fails → Option C (stick with EPA)
If Option A works → Consider Option B (full sim)

## 🚀 Status

**Phase 1: COMPLETE ✅**

We successfully:
1. ✅ Scraped real PFF data (via Playwright)
2. ✅ Calculated matchup metrics (OL vs DL)
3. ✅ Ran correlation tests
4. ✅ Validated statistical significance

**Conclusion**: PFF matchup data has predictive power, but it's not better than the market spread alone. The next step is to test if it adds incremental value when combined with our EPA model.
