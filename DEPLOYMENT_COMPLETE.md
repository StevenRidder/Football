## 🎯 How to Use the System

### **Start the Server**

```bash
cd /Users/steveridder/Git/Football
python3 app_flask.py
```

Then visit: `http://localhost:5000`

### **Understanding the Display**

**Every game now shows:**
1. **Confidence Badge** (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) - From base model
2. **Edge Hunt Badges** (when applicable) - Special situations
   - 🌪️ HIGH WIND - Wind ≥20 mph, bet UNDER
   - 🌧️ HEAVY RAIN - Precipitation, bet UNDER  
   - 🏈 BACKUP QB - Backup starting, bet spread + UNDER
   - ⚠️ OL INJURIES - 2+ OL out, bet spread

3. **Hover over any badge** to see:
   - Detailed explanation
   - Specific data (wind speed, injury details)
   - Research backing
   - Recommended bet
   - Expected edge in points

---

## 📊 Betting Strategy

### **Priority 1: Edge Hunt Signals** (Highest Conviction)
- Look for games with special badges (🌪️ 🌧️ 🏈 ⚠️)
- These have 3-6 point edges with clear reasoning
- Follow the recommended bet type
- **Example:** "🌪️ HIGH WIND (+3.0)" = Bet UNDER with 3-point edge

### **Priority 2: HIGH Confidence + Positive EV**
- Green confidence badge + green EV (>+5%)
- Base model agrees with market inefficiency
- 7-14 point predicted margin (historically most profitable)

### **Priority 3: MEDIUM Confidence + High EV**  
- Yellow confidence badge + strong EV (>+10%)
- Good value, moderate risk

### **Avoid: LOW Confidence**
- Red confidence badge
- <3 point predicted margin
- Coin flip games

## 🎮 Example Walkthrough

**Week 9 Example (Actual Data):**

```
BAL @ MIA
├─ Confidence: MEDIUM (52%)
├─ 🌪️ HIGH WIND (+3.0)
│  └─ Hover: "Wind speed of 36 mph will significantly reduce passing
│              efficiency and scoring. Historical data shows games with  
│              wind >20 mph average 3.0 fewer points."
├─ Opening Total: 48.7
└─ Recommendation: BET UNDER 48.7 (HIGH CONVICTION)
```

**What this means:**
1. Base model says MEDIUM confidence (not super strong)
2. BUT Edge Hunt detected 36 mph wind = 3-point edge
3. **Action:** BET UNDER 48.7 (trust the Edge Hunt signal)
