# Historical Model Performance: Weeks 1-7 (2025 Season)

## Executive Summary

**Total Games Analyzed:** 108 games across 7 weeks

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Result | Grade |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Winner Accuracy** | 63.9% | 🟡 C+ |
| **Avg Spread Error** | 9.73 points | 🟡 B- |
| **Avg Total Error** | 13.67 points | 🔴 C |
| **Spread Bet Accuracy** | 47.2% | 🔴 D |

### What This Means

- **Winner Accuracy (63.9%)**: The model correctly predicted the game winner about 2 out of 3 times. This is decent but below professional standards (70%+).
- **Spread Error (9.73 pts)**: On average, the model's predicted margin was off by ~10 points. This is acceptable for NFL (typical is 8-12 points).
- **Total Error (13.67 pts)**: The model struggled more with predicting total scores, off by nearly 14 points on average.
- **Spread Bet Accuracy (47.2%)**: **CRITICAL ISSUE** - The model's betting recommendations were essentially coin-flip accuracy. You need 52.4% to break even with typical -110 odds.

### Performance Trends

**Best Week:** Week 7 (86.7% winner accuracy)
**Worst Week:** Week 5 (35.7% winner accuracy) - but ironically had the best bet accuracy (71.4%)!
**Most Consistent:** Week 7 (lowest spread error at 7.93 points)
**Most Volatile:** Week 1 (highest total error at 21.26 points)

## Biggest Model Failures

### Week 1
- **LV @ NE**: Predicted 15-34 (NE wins), Actual 20-13 (LV wins) - **Off by 25 points!**
- **DET @ GB**: Predicted 36-31 (DET wins), Actual 13-27 (GB wins) - **Off by 19 points**

### Week 3
- **CIN @ MIN**: Predicted 34-25 (CIN wins), Actual 10-48 (MIN wins) - **Off by 48 points!**
- **DAL @ CHI**: Predicted 34-21 (DAL wins), Actual 14-31 (CHI wins) - **Off by 30 points**

### Week 5
- **HOU @ BAL**: Predicted 27-18 (HOU wins), Actual 44-10 (BAL wins) - **Off by 25 points**
- **NYG @ NO**: Predicted 29-18 (NYG wins), Actual 14-26 (NO wins) - **Off by 23 points**

### Week 7
- **MIA @ CLE**: Predicted 25-18 (MIA wins), Actual 6-31 (CLE wins) - **Off by 32 points!**

## Analysis & Insights

### What the Model Got Right ✅

1. **Week 7 was excellent**: 86.7% winner accuracy shows the model can perform well
2. **Spread predictions improving**: Error decreased from 10.4 (Week 1) to 7.9 (Week 7)
3. **Directional accuracy**: 64% winner prediction is better than random

### What the Model Got Wrong ❌

1. **Betting recommendations are unprofitable**: 47.2% accuracy means you'd lose money
2. **High variance**: Week 5 had only 35.7% winner accuracy (terrible)
3. **Total predictions weak**: 13.67 point error is too high
4. **Blowout blind spots**: Model completely missed several blowouts (CIN@MIN, MIA@CLE)

### Why the Model Struggles 🤔

1. **Underweighting recent form**: Teams that got hot/cold mid-season weren't captured
2. **Missing injury impact**: Major injuries (especially QB) not properly weighted
3. **Home field advantage miscalculated**: Some home teams overvalued
4. **Divisional games unpredictable**: Model treats them like any other game
5. **Weather/conditions**: Not enough weight on outdoor cold weather games

---

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Immediate Fixes (High Impact)

1. **Recalibrate spread predictions**: Current calibration factor (0.85) may still be too aggressive
2. **Add QB-specific adjustments**: Backup QB starts should have -7 to -10 point penalty
3. **Increase recent game weight**: Last 3 games should matter more than current 0.7 weight
4. **Add blowout detection**: When model predicts >14 point spread, reduce confidence

### Medium-Term Improvements

1. **Implement XGBoost**: Current Ridge regression is too simple (already in TODO)
2. **Add team momentum features**: Win/loss streaks, point differential trends
3. **Better injury modeling**: Not just injury count, but positional importance
4. **Divisional game adjustments**: Add -2 to -3 point "chaos factor" for division games

### Long-Term Strategy

1. **Live model updates**: Update predictions as news breaks (injuries, weather)
2. **Ensemble modeling**: Combine multiple models for better accuracy
3. **Market efficiency analysis**: Don't bet when Vegas line is very close to model
4. **Bankroll management**: Even with 55% accuracy, poor bankroll management loses money

## Bottom Line

**Current Status:** The model is **NOT PROFITABLE** for betting. At 47.2% accuracy on spread bets, you would lose approximately **-4.8% of your bankroll** over these 7 weeks (assuming standard -110 odds).

**Break-Even Target:** 52.4% accuracy
**Current Performance:** 47.2% accuracy
**Gap:** -5.2 percentage points

**Estimated Loss:** If you bet $100 per game for 108 games:
- Total wagered: $10,800
- Expected return: ~$10,280
- **Net loss: -$520 (-4.8%)**

**Recommendation:** DO NOT use this model for real money betting until accuracy improves to at least 53-54% consistently over multiple weeks.
