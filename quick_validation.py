1. SCALE DOWN PREDICTIONS
   Multiply model totals by calibration factor:

2. ADD DEFENSIVE WEIGHTING
   Model might be overweighting offense, underweighting defense

3. ADJUST HOME FIELD ADVANTAGE
   Current: +1.5 pts might be contributing to high totals

4. TUNE REGRESSION PARAMETERS
   Ridge alpha might need adjustment

5. RUN FULL BACKTEST
   Test calibration on Weeks 1-7 to find optimal correction
