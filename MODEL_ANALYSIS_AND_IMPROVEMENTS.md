# NFL Betting Model Analysis & Improvement Plan

## 📊 Current Model Analysis

### What Your Model Currently Uses:

#### Core Features (from `features.py`):
1. **Offensive EPA per play** (67% recent, 33% season average)
2. **Defensive EPA per play** (67% recent, 33% season average)
3. **Offensive Success Rate** (currently NaN - **NOT WORKING**)
4. **Defensive Success Rate** (currently NaN - **NOT WORKING**)
5. **Points scored** (blend of recent and season)
6. **Points allowed** (blend of recent and season)

#### Environmental Factors (from `features.py`):
7. **Wind speed** (with dome adjustment)
8. **Temperature** (fetched but not used in model)
9. **Precipitation** (fetched but not used in model)
10. **Injury index** (placeholder - always 0.0 - **NOT WORKING**)

#### Model Parameters:
- **Algorithm**: Ridge Regression (simple linear model)
- **Home field advantage**: 1.5 points
- **Team standard deviation**: 8.0 points
- **Calibration factor**: 0.69 (very conservative)
- **Recent weight**: 67% (last 4 games vs season average)

---

## 🚨 Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Success Rate Features Are Broken**
- Lines 108-109 in `data_ingest.py` set success rates to `NaN`
- Your model is missing 2 of its 6 core features!
- **Impact**: Model is only using 4 features instead of 6

### 2. **Injury Data Is Placeholder**
- Line 340-344 in `data_ingest.py` returns 0.0 for all teams
- You're not accounting for injuries at all
- **Impact**: Missing critical information about team strength

### 3. **Weather Data Not Fully Utilized**
- Temperature and precipitation are fetched but ignored
- Only wind is used (and only for dome games)
- **Impact**: Missing predictive signals from weather

### 4. **Model Is Too Simple**
- Ridge Regression is a basic linear model
- Can't capture complex interactions (e.g., "good offense vs bad defense")
- **Impact**: Missing non-linear patterns

### 5. **No Situational Factors**
- Missing: rest days, travel distance, time zones, divisional games
- Missing: home/away splits, primetime performance
- Missing: coaching matchups, referee tendencies
- **Impact**: Ignoring context that affects outcomes

### 6. **Over-Calibrated**
- `score_calibration_factor: 0.69` is extremely conservative
- You're predicting scores 31% lower than the model thinks
- **Impact**: Your model doesn't trust itself

## 🎯 Recommended Improvements (Priority Order)

### **PRIORITY 1: Fix Broken Features**

#### 1.1 Fix Success Rate Calculation
**Current Problem**: Lines 108-109 set success rates to NaN
**Solution**: Calculate from nflverse data

```python
# In data_ingest.py, replace lines 108-109 with:
def calculate_success_rate(df):
    """
    Success rate = % of plays that gain:
    - 50%+ of yards needed on 1st down
    - 70%+ of yards needed on 2nd down  
    - 100%+ of yards needed on 3rd/4th down
    """
    # This requires play-by-play data, not team-week summaries
    # Alternative: Use EPA as proxy (EPA > 0 = success)
    return (df['passing_epa'] + df['rushing_epa'] > 0).mean()

# For now, use EPA-based success rate:
off_success_rate = ((df['passing_epa'] + df['rushing_epa']) > 0).astype(float)
def_success_rate = ((joined['opp_passing_epa'] + joined['opp_rushing_epa']) > 0).astype(float)
```

#### 1.2 Implement Real Injury Data
**Current Problem**: Always returns 0.0
**Solution**: Use NFL injury reports

```python
def fetch_injury_index(matchups=None):
    """
    Fetch injury data from nflverse or ESPN
    Calculate injury impact score based on:
    - Number of starters out
    - Position importance (QB = 10, RB/WR = 3, OL = 2, etc.)
    """
    import requests
    
    # Option 1: nflverse injuries
    url = "https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases/download/injuries/injuries_2025.csv"
    injuries = pd.read_csv(url)
    
    # Option 2: ESPN depth charts + injury reports
    # (requires scraping)
    
    # Calculate weighted injury index
    injury_weights = {
        'QB': 10.0,
        'RB': 3.0,
        'WR': 3.0,
        'TE': 2.0,
        'OL': 2.0,
        'DL': 2.0,
        'LB': 2.0,
        'CB': 3.0,
        'S': 2.0
    }
    
    # Return injury_index per team (0-20 scale)
    return injury_df
```

---

### **PRIORITY 2: Add Critical Missing Features**

#### 2.1 Rest & Travel
```python
def calculate_rest_advantage(schedule_df):
    """
    - Days of rest since last game (3-14 days)
    - Travel distance (miles)
    - Time zone changes (0-3 hours)
    - Thursday night game penalty (-2 points)
    """
    rest_days = (current_game_date - last_game_date).days
    travel_miles = haversine(home_stadium, away_stadium)
    timezone_diff = abs(home_tz - away_tz)
    
    # Penalties:
    # - Short rest (< 6 days): -1.5 points
    # - Long travel (> 1500 miles): -0.5 points
    # - 2+ timezone changes: -1.0 points
    
    return rest_advantage
```

#### 2.2 Situational Context
```python
def add_situational_features(matches, schedule):
    """
    - Divisional game (1/0)
    - Conference game (1/0)
    - Primetime game (SNF/MNF/TNF)
    - Playoff implications (1/0)
    - Revenge game (lost to this team recently)
    """
    matches['is_divisional'] = matches.apply(lambda r: same_division(r['away'], r['home']), axis=1)
    matches['is_primetime'] = matches['kickoff_time'].apply(lambda t: t.hour >= 20)
    matches['week_in_season'] = current_week  # Early season vs late season
    
    return matches
```

#### 2.3 Quarterback-Specific Stats
```python
def get_qb_stats(team):
    """
    - QB rating
    - Completion %
    - Yards per attempt
    - TD:INT ratio
    - Sack rate
    - QBR (ESPN's Total QBR)
    """
    # Fetch from nflverse player stats
    url = f"https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases/download/player_stats/player_stats_2025.csv"
    qb_stats = pd.read_csv(url)
    
    # Get starting QB for each team
    return qb_metrics
```

#### 2.4 Advanced Metrics
```python
def fetch_advanced_metrics(teams):
    """
    Option 1: DVOA (Defense-adjusted Value Over Average)
    - Requires Football Outsiders subscription
    
    Option 2: FPI (Football Power Index)
    - Scrape from ESPN
    
    Option 3: PFF Grades
    - Requires Pro Football Focus subscription
    
    Option 4: Calculate your own "DVOA-lite"
    - Adjust EPA by opponent strength
    """
    # Opponent-adjusted EPA:
    for team in teams:
        opp_def_epa_avg = get_opponents_avg_def_epa(team)
        team['adj_off_epa'] = team['off_epa'] - opp_def_epa_avg
    
    return teams
```

---

### **PRIORITY 3: Upgrade Model Algorithm**

#### 3.1 Switch from Ridge to Gradient Boosting
**Why**: Captures non-linear patterns and feature interactions

```python
# In model.py, replace Ridge with XGBoost or LightGBM:
from xgboost import XGBRegressor

def fit_expected_points_model(history: pd.DataFrame):
    X_cols = [
        # Original features
        "away_OFF_EPA", "home_DEF_EPA", "away_OFF_SR", "home_DEF_SR",
        "home_OFF_EPA", "away_DEF_EPA", "home_OFF_SR", "away_DEF_SR",
        "away_PF_adj", "home_PA", "home_PF_adj", "away_PA",
        
        # NEW features
        "away_rest_days", "home_rest_days",
        "away_travel_miles", "timezone_diff",
        "away_qb_rating", "home_qb_rating",
        "away_injury_index", "home_injury_index",
        "is_divisional", "is_primetime",
        "away_adj_off_epa", "home_adj_def_epa",
    ]
    
    X = history[X_cols].fillna(0.0).values
    y_away = history["away_PF_adj"].values
    y_home = history["home_PF_adj"].values
    
    # XGBoost with tuned hyperparameters
    away_model = XGBRegressor(
        n_estimators=200,
        max_depth=6,
        learning_rate=0.05,
        subsample=0.8,
        colsample_bytree=0.8,
        random_state=42
    ).fit(X, y_away)
    
    home_model = XGBRegressor(
        n_estimators=200,
        max_depth=6,
        learning_rate=0.05,
        subsample=0.8,
        colsample_bytree=0.8,
        random_state=42
    ).fit(X, y_home)
    
    return away_model, home_model, X_cols
```

#### 3.2 Add Ensemble Model
```python
def create_ensemble_model(history):
    """
    Combine multiple models:
    1. XGBoost (captures non-linear patterns)
    2. Ridge (baseline linear)
    3. Neural Network (deep patterns)
    
    Final prediction = weighted average
    """
    xgb_pred = xgb_model.predict(X)
    ridge_pred = ridge_model.predict(X)
    nn_pred = nn_model.predict(X)
    
    # Weighted by historical accuracy
    final_pred = 0.5 * xgb_pred + 0.3 * ridge_pred + 0.2 * nn_pred
    
    return final_pred
```

---

### **PRIORITY 4: Improve Calibration**

#### 4.1 Remove Over-Calibration
```python
# In config.yaml, change:
score_calibration_factor: 0.69  # TOO CONSERVATIVE

# To:
score_calibration_factor: 0.95  # Trust your model more
```

#### 4.2 Dynamic Calibration by Situation
```python
def get_calibration_factor(matchup):
    """
    Adjust calibration based on:
    - Confidence (high variance = lower calibration)
    - Game type (divisional = more unpredictable)
    - Weather (extreme weather = lower calibration)
    """
    base_calibration = 0.95
    
    if matchup['is_divisional']:
        base_calibration *= 0.95  # Divisional games are closer
    
    if matchup['wind_kph'] > 30:
        base_calibration *= 0.92  # High wind = lower scoring
    
    if matchup['away_injury_index'] > 10 or matchup['home_injury_index'] > 10:
        base_calibration *= 0.93  # Injuries = more uncertainty
    
    return base_calibration
```

## 💡 Why Your Model Failed This Week

Without seeing the specific games, here are likely reasons:

1. **Missing injuries**: If a key player was out, your model didn't know
2. **Rest disadvantage**: Thursday night games, short weeks
3. **Divisional games**: Division rivals are unpredictable (model assumes normal distribution)
4. **Weather**: Extreme conditions your model under-weighted
5. **Over-calibration**: Your 0.69 factor made you too conservative on good bets

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Run the quick wins** (30 minutes)
2. **Backtest on Week 8 data** to validate improvements
3. **Implement Priority 1 fixes** (2-3 hours)
4. **Re-run predictions for next week**
5. **Track accuracy improvements** using your accuracy tracker

---

**Want me to implement any of these improvements now?** I can start with the quick wins or tackle the Priority 1 fixes.
