# üö® CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED
1. ‚úÖ Fixed weather data (km/h ‚Üí mph conversion)
2. ‚úÖ Created adjusted recommendations system (ADJUSTED vs MARKET)
3. ‚úÖ Moved injury report to game detail pages
4. ‚úÖ Fixed JavaScript undefined errors
5. ‚úÖ LLM injury detection working (OpenAI)

## ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE: Market Lines Are Wrong

### Problem
**The predictions are using MODEL predictions as "market lines", not REAL market lines from sportsbooks!**

Example - CAR @ GB:
- **Real Market:** GB -12.5, Total 44.5
- **What's in CSV:** Spread 10.97, Total 49.08 (MODEL predictions!)

This means:
- ‚ùå Market-implied scores are wrong
- ‚ùå Adjusted scores are wrong
- ‚ùå Betting recommendations are wrong
- ‚ùå We're comparing our model to itself, not to the market!

### Solution

**Step 1: Get your Odds API key**
Visit: https://the-odds-api.com/

**Step 2: Set environment variable**
```bash
export ODDS_API_KEY='your-real-key-here'
```

**Step 3: Fetch real market lines**
```bash
cd /Users/steveridder/Git/Football
python3 fetch_current_market_lines.py
```

This will:
1. Fetch current lines from The Odds API
2. Update `predictions_2025_2025-10-28.csv` with REAL market lines
3. Replace model predictions with actual sportsbook numbers

**Step 4: Regenerate signals**
```bash
python3 precompute_edge_hunt_signals.py
```

**Step 5: Restart Flask**
```bash
lsof -ti:9876 | xargs kill -9
python3 app_flask.py
```

## How It Should Work (Once Fixed)

### Example: CAR @ GB

**1. Market Lines (from Odds API):**
- Spread: GB -12.5
- Total: 44.5

**2. Market-Implied Score:**
```
Away - Home = 12.5 (GB favored by 12.5)
Away + Home = 44.5
‚Üí CAR = 16, GB = 29
```

**3. Apply Adjustments:**
- No injuries detected
- No weather signals
- **Adjusted = Market** (16-29)

**4. Betting Decision:**
- Adjusted Total: 45 (16+29)
- Market Total: 44.5
- Edge: 0.5 points (too small)
- **Recommendation: SKIP**

### Example: MIN @ DET (With Injury)

**1. Market Lines:**
- Spread: DET -8.5
- Total: 47.5

**2. Market-Implied Score:**
```
Home - Away = 8.5 (DET favored)
Away + Home = 47.5
‚Üí MIN = 19.5, DET = 28
```

**3. Apply Adjustments:**
- MIN: -10 points (Wentz out, 2 OL out)
- DET: 0 points
- **Adjusted: MIN 9.5, DET 28**

**4. Betting Decision:**
- Adjusted Spread: DET -18.5
- Market Spread: DET -8.5
- **Spread Edge: 10 points ‚Üí BET DET -8.5** ‚úÖ

- Adjusted Total: 37.5 (9.5+28)
- Market Total: 47.5
- **Total Edge: 10 points ‚Üí BET UNDER 47.5** ‚úÖ

## Current Status

### What's Working ‚úÖ
- LLM injury detection (OpenAI)
- Weather data (fixed km/h conversion)
- Adjusted recommendation logic
- Flask API serving data
- UI displaying scores

### What's Broken ‚ùå
- **Market lines are model predictions, not real market**
- All calculations are based on fake market data
- Can't trust any betting recommendations until this is fixed

## Quick Test After Fix

Run this to verify:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9876/api/games | python3 -c "
import json, sys
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
car_gb = [g for g in data if g['away'] == 'CAR' and g['home'] == 'GB'][0]
print(f'Market Spread: {car_gb[\"market_spread\"]}')
print(f'Market Total: {car_gb[\"market_total\"]}')
print(f'Expected: -12.5, 44.5')
"
```

Should show:
```
Market Spread: -12.5
Market Total: 44.5
Expected: -12.5, 44.5
```

## Files Created

1. **`fetch_current_market_lines.py`** - Fetches real market lines from Odds API
2. **`nfl_edge/adjusted_recommendations.py`** - Generates betting recs (ADJUSTED vs MARKET)
3. **`edge_hunt/llm_injury_detector.py`** - LLM-powered injury detection
4. **`market_implied_scores.py`** - Converts lines ‚Üî scores

---

## Next Steps

1. **GET ODDS API KEY** (critical!)
2. Run `fetch_current_market_lines.py`
3. Verify market lines are correct
4. Run `precompute_edge_hunt_signals.py`
5. Restart Flask
6. Test with Playwright to verify UI

**Without real market lines, the entire system is comparing the model to itself, which is useless for betting.**
