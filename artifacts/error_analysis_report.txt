================================================================================
ERROR PATTERNS:
================================================================================

High Confidence Errors:
  Count: 2
  Insight: Model was overconfident in these predictions

Close Games:
  Count: 2
  Insight: Model struggles with toss-up games

Total Prediction Errors:
  Count: 2
  Insight: Model had trouble predicting scoring levels

Large Margin Errors:
  Count: 2
  Insight: Model significantly misjudged the margin of victory

================================================================================
SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS:
================================================================================

1. Calibration Adjustment (Priority: High)
   Reason: 2 high-confidence errors detected
   Implementation: Apply probability shrinkage: move predictions closer to 50% baseline
   Parameter: confidence_shrinkage_factor = 0.85

2. Uncertainty for Close Matchups (Priority: Medium)
   Reason: 2 errors in close games
   Implementation: Increase variance in Monte Carlo for evenly-matched teams
   Parameter: close_game_variance_multiplier = 1.3

3. Scoring Level Calibration (Priority: Medium)
   Reason: Total points off by average of 12.4 points
   Implementation: Adjust offensive/defensive EPA weightings

4. Add Momentum Features (Priority: Low)
   Reason: Model may not capture recent team momentum
   Implementation: Weight recent 3 games more heavily than season averages
   Parameter: recent_games_weight = 0.6

5. Home Field Advantage (Priority: Low)
   Reason: May need better home field adjustment
   Implementation: Tune home field advantage multiplier
   Parameter: home_field_points = 2.5

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS:
================================================================================
1. Create Model v2 with suggested improvements
2. Backtest Model v2 on historical data
3. Compare Model v2 vs Base Model performance
4. If v2 is better, consider replacing base model OR
5. Use ensemble approach (average both models)
