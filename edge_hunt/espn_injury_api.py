Robust ESPN Injury API Parser

This is the PRIMARY source for injury data. It:
1. Fetches from official ESPN API (free, no key needed)
2. Handles all 32 NFL teams
3. Includes retry logic and error handling
4. Returns structured injury data
5. Validates responses

ESPN API is updated multiple times per day during the season.
