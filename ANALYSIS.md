# NFL Edge "Killer App" - What We Have vs What's Next

## Executive Summary

**You're 70-75% there.** The core architecture is built and working. The data layer, Monte Carlo engine, feature engineering, and basic edge detection all exist. What's missing is: (1) Kelly sizing/EV calculations, (2) backtesting infrastructure, (3) narrative explanations, and (4) calibration validation.

## ‚úÖ What's FULLY Built (Already Working)

### 1. **Data Ingestion Pipeline** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Status**: Production-ready, robust error handling

### 2. **Feature Engineering** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Status**: Production-ready with smart weighting

- ‚úÖ Rolling 4-week averages (recent form)
- ‚úÖ Expanding season averages (full season baseline)
- ‚úÖ Exponential blend (recent_weight=0.67 favors last 4 games)
- ‚úÖ Off/Def EPA per play, success rates
- ‚úÖ Points scored/allowed with weather/injury adjustments
- ‚úÖ Wind penalty for outdoor games (>25 kph)
- ‚úÖ Injury impact on scoring (-0.8 pts per index point)

**Code**: `nfl_edge/features.py` (40 lines)

**Evidence**: Debug CSV shows 12 engineered features per matchup.

---

### 3. **Predictive Model** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## üü° What's PARTIALLY Built

### 8. **Injury Impact** üü° 50% DONE
**What works**: 
- Interface exists
- Weather-adjusted scoring works
- Stub returns zeros

**What's missing**:
- Real injury severity data source
- Player position weighting (QB >> WR >> RB)
- Historical on/off splits

**Effort**: 2-4 hours to integrate a real injury feed

---

## ‚ùå What's NOT Built Yet (Priority Order)

### 1. **Kelly Sizing & EV Calculation** ‚ùå HIGH PRIORITY
**Why it matters**: Edge detection without sizing is incomplete

**What's needed**:
```python
def calculate_ev_and_stake(model_prob, market_odds, edge_threshold=0.025):
    """
    - Convert model prob to fair odds
    - Compare to market odds
    - Calculate EV%
    - Apply Kelly criterion with cap (25-50%)
    - Return recommended stake as % bankroll
    """
```

**Outputs**:
- EV% column in projections
- Recommended stake size
- Filter by minimum EV threshold
- Bankroll tracking over time

**Effort**: 4-6 hours

**Impact**: HIGH - turns predictions into actionable bets

---

### 2. **Backtesting Infrastructure** ‚ùå HIGH PRIORITY
**Why it matters**: Can't trust predictions without historical validation

**What's needed**:
```python
def backtest_season(year, start_week, end_week):
    """
    - Loop through historical weeks
    - Run same pipeline with past data
    - Compare predictions to actual results
    - Compute: Brier score, log loss, hit rate by edge bucket
    - Generate calibration plots
    - Track P&L by stake size
    """
```

**Outputs**:
- Calibration report showing predicted % vs actual %
- P&L curve by week
- Hit rate by edge size (e.g., 2-5% edge, 5-10% edge)
- Sharpe ratio, max drawdown
- artifacts/backtest_{season}_results.csv

**Effort**: 8-12 hours (need historical results data)

**Impact**: CRITICAL - proves signal exists before real money

---

### 3. **Narrative Explanations** ‚ùå MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Why it matters**: Transparency and debugging

**What's needed**:
```python
def generate_game_rationale(matchup, features, edge_pts):
    """
    - Identify top 3 contributing features (coefficients √ó values)
    - Template: "KC favored by [X] because [reasons]:
      1. Offense ranks [Y] in EPA/play vs [opp] defense ([Z] EPA)
      2. Weather: [W] mph winds favor run-heavy [team]
      3. Injuries: [player] out reduces [team] scoring by [pts]"
    """
```

**Outputs**:
- One paragraph per game in projections
- Feature importance table
- Human-readable explanations for Streamlit

**Effort**: 6-8 hours

**Impact**: MEDIUM - improves trust and debugging

---

### 4. **Calibration Validation** ‚ùå MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Why it matters**: Probabilities must match reality

**What's needed**:
```python
def calibration_report(backtest_results):
    """
    - Bin predictions (0-10%, 10-20%, ..., 90-100%)
    - Compare to actual outcome frequency
    - Compute reliability diagram
    - Test: slope ‚âà 1, intercept ‚âà 0
    - Adjust team_sd if needed
    """
```

**Outputs**:
- Calibration plots (predicted vs actual)
- Brier skill score
- Recommended model adjustments

**Effort**: 4-6 hours

**Impact**: HIGH - ensures probabilities are honest

---

### 5. **Advanced Modeling** ‚ùå LOWER PRIORITY
**Why it matters**: Potential edge improvements

**What could improve**:
- Poisson/Skellam instead of Normal (better for low-scoring games)
- Bayesian priors from historical team performance
- Situational adjustments (divisional games, primetime, etc.)
- Pace/tempo modeling (possessions per game)
- Red zone efficiency vs field position models
- Correlation between team performances (weather affects both)

**Effort**: 20-40 hours (research + implementation)

**Impact**: UNKNOWN - need backtest to prove value

---

### 6. **Data Quality & Ops** ‚ùå LOWER PRIORITY
**What's missing**:
- Unit tests for parsers
- CI pipeline
- Cache/replay for API failures
- Alert system if predictions seem wild
- Scheduled runs (cron/GitHub Actions)

**Effort**: 8-12 hours

**Impact**: MEDIUM - prevents production issues

## üéØ Recommended Roadmap

### Phase 1: Make It Bettable (1-2 days)
1. **Add Kelly sizing & EV** (4-6h)
   - Calculate true EV from model probs vs market odds
   - Implement fractional Kelly with 25-50% cap
   - Add "Recommended Bet" and "Stake %" columns

2. **Add backtest harness** (8-12h)
   - Fetch historical results (nflverse has them)
   - Run past 2-3 seasons out-of-sample
   - Output P&L, hit rate, calibration stats

3. **Validate calibration** (4-6h)
   - Plot predicted vs actual
   - Tune team_sd if needed
   - Ensure 60% predictions hit ~60% of time

**Output**: Confidence that the edge is real + stake sizing

---

### Phase 2: Make It Explainable (1 day)
4. **Add narrative rationales** (6-8h)
   - Template-based explanations
   - Feature importance per game
   - Add to dashboard

**Output**: Human-readable reasoning for each bet

---

### Phase 3: Harden for Production (1-2 days)
5. **Real injury data** (2-4h)
6. **Unit tests** (4-6h)
7. **Scheduled runs** (2-3h)

**Output**: Reliable weekly automation

---

### Phase 4: Research Edge Improvements (Optional)
8. **Advanced models** (weeks)
9. **Situational factors** (weeks)

**Output**: Incremental edge gains (maybe)

---

## üöÄ Next Steps (Concrete)

If you want to proceed, I recommend:

**Immediate (today)**:
1. Run a quick sanity check on current predictions
2. Decide if you want me to build Kelly sizing first OR backtesting first
3. Identify where to get historical game results (nflverse likely has them)

**This week**:
1. Ship Kelly sizing + EV calculations
2. Build backtest harness with 2023-2024 data
3. Validate calibration and tune variance

**This month**:
1. Add rationales
2. Wire real injury data
3. Run live for 2-3 weeks to validate

---

## üí° Bottom Line

**You have a working predictive engine.** It ingests data, builds features, simulates outcomes, and flags edges. The "killer app" architecture is 70% done.

**What's missing is validation.** You need to prove the edge is real via backtesting, size bets properly via Kelly, and explain predictions via rationales.

**Estimated time to "production ready"**: 3-5 days of focused work.

**Estimated time to "killer app"**: 1-2 weeks including validation and polish.

You're closer than you think. Want me to start with Kelly sizing or backtesting?
