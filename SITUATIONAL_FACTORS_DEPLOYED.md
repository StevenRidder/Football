## 🧪 NEXT STEPS - BACKTEST REQUIRED

### Step 1: Backtest on Weeks 1-8
```bash
# Create backtest script that:
# 1. Loads historical games (Weeks 1-8)
# 2. Applies situational factors
# 3. Compares to closing lines
# 4. Measures CLV rate and ROI
```

**Success Criteria:**
- CLV Rate: ≥55% (better than coin flip)
- Avg CLV: ≥+0.5 pts
- ROI: Positive over 50+ bets

### Step 2: If Backtest Passes
- ✅ Keep situational factors
- ✅ Add to production
- ✅ Track Week 9 results

### Step 3: If Backtest Fails
- ❌ Remove situational factors
- ❌ Market already prices these
- ❌ Try next feature (OL continuity)

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### What Worked
1. **Fast implementation** - No slow nflverse calls
2. **Pre-computed data** - 2025 home/away records cached
3. **Simple calculations** - Distance, win rates, divisions
4. **12/14 games** - Much better coverage than QB injuries alone

### What to Watch
1. **Are these already priced?** - Need backtest to confirm
2. **Sample size** - Only 8 weeks of data for home/away splits
3. **Regression to mean** - Teams that struggle may improve

### Why This Might Work
- **Early-week info** - Home/away records known Monday
- **Market lag** - Casual bettors don't adjust for travel/splits
- **Combination effects** - Multiple factors compound

## 🎯 BETTING STRATEGY

### Current Week (Week 9)
- **4 recommended bets** (all totals)
- **$100 per bet** = $400 total exposure
- **Track results** for CLV measurement

### Discipline
- Only bet when edge ≥2.0 pts
- Track opening vs closing lines
- Measure CLV rate after Week 9
