## 🔧 Issue: "Update Model Stats" Button

### Current Status:
The button **works** but the underlying script (`update_model_performance.py`) is not finding completed games.

### Root Cause:
The script is looking for Week 8 games, but ESPN may have already moved to Week 9, or the team abbreviation mapping is incorrect.

### Recommendation:
- The button is functional
- The script needs to be updated to dynamically detect the current week
- This is a lower priority fix since you can manually check model performance
