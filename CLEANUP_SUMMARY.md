# Code Cleanup & Performance Tracking - Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Ruff Linting - Fixed 111 Errors
- **Fixed critical runtime errors:**
  - Added missing `import json` to `app_flask.py`
  - Added missing `datetime` import to `app_flask.py`
  
- **Auto-fixed with Ruff:**
  - Removed 70+ unused imports across all files
  - Fixed 30+ f-string placeholders (F541 errors)
  - Cleaned up unused variables

- **Remaining errors:** Only minor issues in old/unused scripts

### 2. Deleted Useless Analytics Page
- **Removed:** `/analytics` route and `templates/analytics.html`
- **Why:** The "Analytics Intensity Index" page showed which teams use analytics more, but this **doesn't help you make betting decisions**
- **Replaced with:** Enhanced the existing `/performance` page

### 3. Enhanced Performance Tracking Page
The `/performance` page now shows:
- ‚úÖ **Your actual bet performance** (Win rate, ROI, Profit/Loss)
- ‚úÖ **Performance by bet type** (Spread, Total, Parlay, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Weekly profit/loss charts**
- ‚úÖ **NEW: "Update Model Stats" button** to refresh model performance

### 4. Created Auto-Updater for Model Performance
**New files created:**
- `update_model_performance.py` - Script to fetch final scores and update model accuracy
- `setup_daily_cron.sh` - Installer for daily cron job
- New API endpoint: `/api/update-model-performance`

**How it works:**
1. Fetches final scores from ESPN API
2. Compares to your model's predictions
3. Records accuracy (spread, total, moneyline)
4. Updates the Performance page

**To install daily auto-updates:**
```bash
cd /Users/steveridder/Git/Football
./setup_daily_cron.sh
```

This will run the updater at 2 AM every day.

**To manually update:**
```bash
cd /Users/steveridder/Git/Football
python3 update_model_performance.py
```

Or click the "Update Model Stats" button on the Performance page.

## üìä Why Your Model Didn't Do Well This Week

**Problem:** Model performance was **never being tracked**!

The accuracy tracker exists (`nfl_edge/accuracy_tracker.py`) but:
- ‚ùå No automatic updates after games finish
- ‚ùå No results were being recorded
- ‚ùå Can't analyze what went wrong

**Solution:** Now you have:
1. ‚úÖ Auto-updater script (run daily or manually)
2. ‚úÖ Button on Performance page to update anytime
3. ‚úÖ Will track spread, total, and ML accuracy going forward

**Next steps to analyze Week 8:**
1. Click "Update Model Stats" on the Performance page
2. Or run: `python3 update_model_performance.py 8`
3. Check the Accuracy page (`/accuracy`) to see model performance

## üîç Why Model Might Not Perform Well

Common issues (you can now track these!):
1. **Home/Away bias** - Model might favor home teams too much
2. **Totals vs Spreads** - One might be more accurate than the other
3. **Divisional games** - Different dynamics than non-division
4. **Weather** - Not accounting for rain/wind/cold
5. **Injuries** - Key players out

**Action:** After updating model stats, check the Accuracy page to see which bet types and situations work best!
