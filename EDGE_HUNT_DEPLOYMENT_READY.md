# Edge Hunt: Production-Ready Betting System

**Status:** ✅ **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**  
**Version:** 2.0 (Weather + QB/OL Signals)  
**First Live Test:** Week 10, 2025 NFL Season

---

## Executive Summary

We've built a **clean, disciplined, CLV-focused betting system** that combines:

1. **Weather signals** (wind, precipitation) → Total bets
2. **QB/OL injury signals** (backup QB, OL injuries) → Spread and Total bets
3. **Three-pass collection** (Wed/Fri/Sun) → Measure when value appears
4. **Clear success metrics** → Stop if CLV doesn't work

**Week 9 Test Results:**
- 5 total bets placed (all weather-driven UNDER bets)
- Average edge: 3.0 points
- All triggered on high wind (>29 mph)
- No QB/OL signals detected (no major injuries Week 9)

---

## What We Built

### Core Modules

1. **`edge_hunt/weather_features.py`**
   - Fetches weather from Open-Meteo API (free)
   - Wind speed, precipitation, temperature
   - Bins into actionable categories
   - Timestamps collection for CLV tracking

2. **`edge_hunt/qb_ol_features.py`**
   - Fetches injuries from ESPN API (free)
   - Tracks QB status (starter vs backup)
   - Tracks OL injuries (starters out)
   - Estimates point impact (-6 to -10 for backup QB)

3. **`edge_hunt/feature_transforms.py`**
   - Converts weather to point adjustments
   - Wind ≥20 mph: -3.0 pts
   - Wind 15-20 mph: -1.5 pts
   - Heavy precip: -1.0 pts

4. **`edge_hunt/bet_rules.py`**
   - Simple threshold gates
   - Total bets: ≥2.0 pts edge
   - Spread bets: ≥3.0 pts edge

5. **`edge_hunt/run_combined_signals.py`**
   - Main runner script
   - Combines weather + QB/OL signals
   - Outputs bet tickets for grading

## How to Use

### Generate Bets for Current Week

```bash
# Wednesday pass (earliest, most CLV potential)
python edge_hunt/run_combined_signals.py --week 10 --pass-name wednesday

# Friday pass (refined forecast + injury reports)
python edge_hunt/run_combined_signals.py --week 10 --pass-name friday

# Sunday pass (final check)
python edge_hunt/run_combined_signals.py --week 10 --pass-name sunday
```

### Output

Each run creates a CSV in `artifacts/` with:
- Game details
- Weather snapshot
- Injury status
- Bet recommendations
- Placeholders for grading

Example: `artifacts/combined_bets_week10_wednesday_*.csv`

## Success Metrics (30-Bet Evaluation)

### Primary Metric: Positive CLV Rate
- **Target:** ≥55% of bets have positive CLV
- **Stop Rule:** If CLV rate ≤45% after 30 bets, we stop

### Secondary Metric: Average CLV
- **Target:** ≥+0.5 points average CLV
- **Stop Rule:** If average CLV <0 after 30 bets, we stop

### Fun Metric: ROI
- **Target:** Positive ROI
- **Note:** This is secondary—CLV is the honest measure

## Expected Signal Distribution

Based on research and Week 9 test:

| Signal | Frequency | Avg Edge | Bet Type | CLV Potential |
|--------|-----------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **High Wind (>20 mph)** | 2-3 games/week | 3.0 pts | Total UNDER | High |
| **Backup QB Starting** | 1-2 games/week | 6.0 pts | Spread + Total | Very High |
| **2+ OL Starters Out** | 1-2 games/week | 4.0 pts | Spread + Total | High |
| **Combined (Weather + Injury)** | 0-1 games/week | 5.0 pts | Both | Very High |

**Expected:** 5-10 bets per week across 3 passes

---

## Three-Pass Strategy

### Why Three Passes?

We collect at three different times to measure **when** value appears:

| Pass | Day | Time | What We Measure |
|------|-----|------|-----------------|
| **Wednesday** | Wed | 6pm ET | Early weather forecast + initial injury reports |
| **Friday** | Fri | 6pm ET | Refined weather + Friday injury report |
| **Sunday** | Sun | Morning | Final weather + inactive list |

**Hypothesis:**
- **Wednesday bets** → Highest CLV (market hasn't priced signals yet)
- **Friday bets** → Moderate CLV (market partially priced)
- **Sunday bets** → Lowest CLV but highest win rate (market fully priced)

**Test:** If Wednesday CLV >> Sunday CLV, we focus on early-week betting

## Week 9 Results (First Test)

**Date:** October 28, 2025 (Sunday Pass)  
**Games Analyzed:** 14  
**Bets Placed:** 5 (all total UNDER bets)  
**Total Stake:** $25.00  
**Average Edge:** 3.0 points

### Bets Placed

| Game | Signal | Opening Total | Wind | Adjustment | Bet | Edge |
|------|--------|---------------|------|------------|-----|------|
| **BAL @ MIA** | Weather | 48.7 | 36.0 mph | -3.0 pts | UNDER | 3.0 pts |
| **CAR @ GB** | Weather | 44.0 | 49.0 mph | -3.0 pts | UNDER | 3.0 pts |
| **ATL @ NE** | Weather | 45.0 | 36.2 mph | -3.0 pts | UNDER | 3.0 pts |
| **SF @ NYG** | Weather | 48.5 | 33.1 mph | -3.0 pts | UNDER | 3.0 pts |
| **SEA @ WAS** | Weather | 45.5 | 29.1 mph | -3.0 pts | UNDER | 3.0 pts |

**Observations:**
- All 5 bets triggered on high wind (>29 mph)
- No QB/OL signals detected (no major injuries Week 9)
- All bets are UNDER (wind reduces scoring)
- Consistent 3.0 point edge (wind ≥20 mph threshold)

**Next:** Grade these bets after games complete to measure CLV

## Comparison to XGBoost Model

| Aspect | XGBoost Model | Edge Hunt |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Features** | 119 (EPA, weather, travel) | 5 (wind, precip, QB, OL) |
| **Complexity** | Black box | Transparent |
| **CLV** | +0.09 points | TBD (testing) |
| **Win Rate** | 73.3% | TBD |
| **Bets/Week** | 87 over 3 weeks | 5-10 expected |
| **Interpretability** | Low | High |
| **Testability** | Hard | Easy |
| **Fun Factor** | Stressful | Fun ✅ |
| **Deployment** | Complex | Simple ✅ |

**Edge Hunt Advantages:**
1. ✅ Simple enough to understand and trust
2. ✅ Fast feedback (5-10 bets/week vs 30 bets/week)
3. ✅ Easy to debug (can see exactly why each bet was placed)
4. ✅ Focused on highest-edge situations (wind, QB injuries)
5. ✅ Three-pass strategy measures timing of value

## Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: Weeks 10-12 (Testing)

**Goal:** Collect 30 bets to evaluate CLV

**Actions:**
1. Run all 3 passes (Wed/Fri/Sun) for each week
2. Place $5 bets as recommended
3. Grade bets after games complete
4. Track CLV by pass (Wed vs Fri vs Sun)

**Success Criteria:**
- Positive CLV rate ≥55%
- Average CLV ≥+0.5 points
- Positive ROI

### Phase 2: Weeks 13-17 (Scaling)

**If Phase 1 succeeds:**
1. ✅ Increase stake to $10/bet
2. ✅ Focus on highest-CLV pass (likely Wednesday)
3. ✅ Add more nuanced QB/OL tracking

**If Phase 1 fails:**
1. ❌ Stop betting
2. ❌ Analyze why (market already prices signals? coefficients wrong?)
3. ❌ Try different signals or retune thresholds

### Phase 3: Playoffs (Refinement)

**If Phase 2 succeeds:**
1. ✅ Integrate into web app
2. ✅ Add automated grading
3. ✅ Add CLV tracking dashboard
4. ✅ Consider adding more signals (travel, pace, etc.)

## Key Differences from XGBoost Approach

### What We Kept
- ✅ CLV as primary metric
- ✅ Rigorous measurement
- ✅ Stop rules
- ✅ Walk-forward validation concept

### What We Changed
- ✅ **Simplified features** - 5 instead of 119
- ✅ **Transparent logic** - Linear adjustments, not ML
- ✅ **Focused bets** - Only highest-edge situations
- ✅ **Three-pass collection** - Measure timing of value
- ✅ **Smaller sample** - 5-10 bets/week for faster feedback

### Why This Is Better
1. **Easier to trust** - You can see exactly why each bet was placed
2. **Faster feedback** - 30 bets in 3 weeks vs 10 weeks
3. **Easier to debug** - If CLV fails, we know which signal failed
4. **More fun** - Small stakes, clear logic, quick results
5. **Better deployment** - Simple scripts, no complex model serving

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 10)

1. **Run Wednesday pass** (Nov 6, 2025)
   ```bash
   python edge_hunt/run_combined_signals.py --week 10 --pass-name wednesday
   ```

2. **Run Friday pass** (Nov 8, 2025)
   ```bash
   python edge_hunt/run_combined_signals.py --week 10 --pass-name friday
   ```

3. **Run Sunday pass** (Nov 10, 2025)
   ```bash
   python edge_hunt/run_combined_signals.py --week 10 --pass-name sunday
   ```

4. **Grade Week 9 bets** after games complete (Nov 3, 2025)

### After 30 Bets (Week 12)

**Evaluate:**
- Positive CLV rate
- Average CLV
- CLV by pass (Wed vs Fri vs Sun)
- ROI

**Decide:**
- Scale up if CLV ≥55%
- Retune if CLV 45-55%
- Stop if CLV <45%

## Philosophy

This system embodies your **Harvard-Expos-style framework**:

1. ✅ **Measure truthfully** - CLV is the only honest metric
2. ✅ **Add one signal at a time** - Weather first, then QB/OL
3. ✅ **Keep it simple** - Linear adjustments, not black-box ML
4. ✅ **Define success before betting** - Clear metrics, stop rules
5. ✅ **Make it fun** - $5 bets, quick feedback, transparent logic

**The goal is not to win every bet.**  
**The goal is to consistently beat the closing line.**

If we can do that, we scale.  
If we can't, we stop and try something else.
