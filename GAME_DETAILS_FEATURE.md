import requests

opta_response = requests.get(f"https://opta-api.com/predictions/{away}/{home}")
opta_data = opta_response.json()

external_predictions = {
    'opta': {
        'away_win': opta_data['away_win_pct'],
        'home_win': opta_data['home_win_pct'],
        'spread': opta_data['spread'],
        'total': opta_data['total']
    },
    # Add ESPN, FPI, etc.

### PPG (Points Per Game):
Average points scored per game (season-to-date).

### PA (Points Allowed):
Average points allowed per game (season-to-date).

### Last 5 Games:
Recent form - more recent games weighted to show momentum.

### Turnovers vs Takeaways:
- **Turnovers**: How many times team gave up the ball
- **Takeaways**: How many times team forced turnovers
