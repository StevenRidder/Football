# âœ… Adjustments Complete - System Working

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Per-Team Adjustments (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem:** Adjustments were being split evenly between both teams
**Solution:** Each team's adjustments (travel, home/away splits) now only affect that specific team's score
**Example:** CHI away struggles (-1.0) only affects CHI, not CIN
**Result:** Spreads now change correctly (CHI @ CIN: +2.5 â†’ +1.0)

### 2. Injury Integration (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem:** LLM-detected injuries weren't being applied to adjusted scores
**Solution:** Combined `situational_away_adj` + `away_total_impact` for each team
**Example:** MIN @ DET with Carson Wentz out + OL injuries = -10.0 pts to MIN
**Result:** Massive spread swing (DET -8.5 â†’ DET -18.5)

### 3. Flask Error Handling
**Problem:** `pd.isna()` failing on arrays
**Solution:** Added try/except wrapper for scalar-only checks
**Result:** API endpoints working reliably
