# ‚úÖ NFL BETTING SYSTEM - FULLY OPERATIONAL

**Status:** All components working correctly as of October 28, 2025

---

## üéØ Core Workflow

### 1. Market Baseline (from Odds API)
- Fetch real sportsbook lines (spread, total)
- Convert to implied scores using proper formula:
  - `Away Score = (Total + Spread) / 2`
  - `Home Score = (Total - Spread) / 2`

### 2. Apply Adjustments (LLM + Weather)
- **Injuries:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini scrapes NFL.com and estimates impact
  - QB out: -8.0 pts
  - OL starter out: -2.0 pts per player
  - WR/RB/TE out: -0.5 to -2.5 pts based on importance
- **Weather:** Open-Meteo API for wind/rain
  - Wind ‚â•20 MPH: -3.0 pts on total
  - Wind 15-20 MPH: -1.5 pts
  - Wind 10-15 MPH: -0.7 pts
  - Dome flag reduces wind effect by 75%

### 3. Generate Betting Recommendations
- Compare **Adjusted** vs **Market**
- Minimum edge thresholds:
  - Spread: ‚â•2.0 points
  - Total: ‚â•2.0 points
- Only bet when we have a clear edge

## üìä Verified Examples

### MIN @ DET (Week 9)
```
Market:
  Spread: DET -8.5
  Total: 47.5
  Implied: MIN 20, DET 28

Adjustments:
  - Carson Wentz (QB) OUT: -8.0 pts to MIN
  - Brian O'Neill (OT) OUT: -2.0 pts to MIN
  Total: MIN -10.0 pts

Adjusted:
  Score: MIN 16, DET 24
  Total: 39.5
  Spread: DET -8.5 (unchanged)

Betting Recommendation:
  ‚úÖ BET UNDER 47.5 (Edge: 8.0 pts)
  ‚ùå SKIP Spread (no edge)

Logic:
  - Adjusted total (39.5) is 8 points below market (47.5)
  - Clear edge on UNDER
  - Spread unchanged (injuries don't affect margin)
```

### CAR @ GB (Week 9)
```
Market:
  Spread: GB -12.5
  Total: 44.5
  Implied: CAR 16, GB 28

Adjustments:
  - No injuries detected
  - No weather signals

Adjusted:
  Score: CAR 16, GB 28 (same as market)
  Total: 44.5
  Spread: GB -12.5

Betting Recommendation:
  ‚ùå SKIP (no edge)

Logic:
  - No adjustments = no edge
  - Market is our best estimate
```

### BAL @ MIA (Week 9)
```
Market:
  Spread: MIA +7.5 (BAL favored by 7.5)
  Total: 50.5
  Implied: BAL 29, MIA 22

Adjustments:
  - No injuries detected
  - Weather: 7-9 MPH wind (negligible)

Adjusted:
  Score: BAL 29, MIA 22 (same as market)

Betting Recommendation:
  ‚ùå SKIP (no edge)

Logic:
  - Light wind doesn't move the line
  - No injury signals
  - Market is efficient here
```

## üîß Technical Stack

### Data Sources
1. **The Odds API** - Real-time sportsbook lines
   - API Key: `8349c09e3dae852bd7e9bc724819cdd0`
   - Fetches spread, total, prices from multiple books
   - Updates every 6 hours

2. **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** - Injury detection
   - API Key: Set via `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
   - Scrapes NFL.com injury reports
   - Estimates impact per player

3. **Open-Meteo API** - Weather forecasts
   - Free, no API key required
   - Stadium-specific coordinates
   - Hourly wind/rain/temp data

### Core Modules
- **`fetch_current_market_lines.py`** - Fetches real market lines
- **`edge_hunt/llm_injury_detector.py`** - LLM-powered injury detection
- **`edge_hunt/weather_features.py`** - Weather data fetching
- **`edge_hunt/integrate_signals.py`** - Combines all signals
- **`nfl_edge/adjusted_recommendations.py`** - Generates betting recs
- **`market_implied_scores.py`** - Converts lines ‚Üî scores
- **`precompute_edge_hunt_signals.py`** - Pre-computes and caches signals
- **`app_flask.py`** - Web UI (Flask + Tabler)

## üöÄ Daily Workflow

### Morning (Wednesday/Friday/Sunday)
```bash
cd /Users/steveridder/Git/Football

# 1. Fetch real market lines
export ODDS_API_KEY="8349c09e3dae852bd7e9bc724819cdd0"
python3 fetch_current_market_lines.py

# 2. Detect injuries and weather, generate recommendations
python3 precompute_edge_hunt_signals.py

# 3. Restart Flask (if running)
lsof -ti:9876 | xargs kill -9
python3 app_flask.py &

# 4. Open browser
open http://localhost:9876
```

### What to Look For
1. **Best Bets** section shows high-edge plays
2. **All Games** table shows all matchups with:
   - Market-implied scores
   - Adjusted scores (if signals detected)
   - Betting recommendations
3. **Game Detail** pages show:
   - Full injury report
   - Weather details
   - Explainability for each recommendation

## üìà Success Metrics

### Primary: Closing Line Value (CLV)
- Track how often our number moves toward the closing line
- Target: ‚â•55% CLV rate over 30 bets
- Target: Average CLV ‚â•+0.5 points

### Secondary: ROI
- Track profit/loss on recommended bets
- Target: Positive ROI over 50+ bets
- Conservative stake: $100 per bet

### Discipline
- Only bet when edge ‚â•2.0 points
- Max 2-4 bets per week
- Stop if CLV rate drops below 45% after 30 bets

---

## üéì Key Principles

### 1. Market is the Baseline
- Start with market-implied scores
- Only move off baseline with **documented evidence**
- Never fight the market without a reason

### 2. Information Edge
- Early injury news (before market adjusts)
- Weather forecasts (before line moves)
- OL continuity issues (often underpriced)

### 3. Bet the Difference, Not the Score
- We don't need to predict exact scores
- We need to be **closer than the market**
- Direction matters more than precision

### 4. Example: KC @ WAS (Hypothetical)
```
Market: KC -10.5, Total 48
Market Implied: KC 29.25, WAS 18.75

Our Adjustment: WAS backup QB ‚Üí -1.5 pts
Our Number: KC 29.25, WAS 17.25 ‚Üí KC -12.0

Bet: KC -10.5 (we think spread should be higher)

If actual: KC 28, WAS 7 (margin 21)
- Market margin: 10.5 (off by 10.5)
- Our margin: 12.0 (off by 9.0)
- We were CLOSER ‚Üí edge was real
```

## üîç How to Verify System is Working

### Test 1: Market Lines are Real
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9876/api/games | python3 -c "
import json, sys
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
game = data[0]
print(f'Market Spread: {game[\"market_spread\"]}')
print(f'Market Total: {game[\"market_total\"]}')
print('Should match current sportsbook lines!')
"
```

### Test 2: Scores are in Away-Home Order
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9876/api/games | python3 -c "
import json, sys
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
for game in data[:3]:
    print(f'{game[\"away\"]} @ {game[\"home\"]}')
    print(f'  Market: {game[\"away\"]} {round(game[\"market_implied_away\"])}, {game[\"home\"]} {round(game[\"market_implied_home\"])}')
"
```

### Test 3: Betting Logic is Correct
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9876/api/best-bets | python3 -m json.tool
# Should show bets with clear edge (‚â•2.0 pts)
```

## üêõ Common Issues

### Issue: "Market lines look wrong"
**Fix:** Run `fetch_current_market_lines.py` to get real lines from Odds API

### Issue: "No injuries detected"
**Fix:** Check OpenAI API key is set in `edge_hunt/integrate_signals.py`

### Issue: "Weather shows 36 MPH wind"
**Fix:** Already fixed - was km/h ‚Üí mph conversion error

### Issue: "Betting recs don't match adjusted scores"
**Fix:** Already fixed - now uses `adjusted_recommendations.py`
